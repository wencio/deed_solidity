Deed Web3 Application
This repository contains a web3 application that interacts with the Deed smart contract to facilitate withdrawals by a designated lawyer.

Description
The application comprises two index.js files and a smart contract Deed.sol. Each index.js file is responsible for interacting with the Ethereum network via Web3.js, while the Deed.sol smart contract defines the logic for withdrawals by the lawyer.

index.js (for Web3 interaction)
The index.js files initialize Web3, connect to the Deed smart contract, and define the logic for facilitating withdrawals by the lawyer.

Deed.sol (Smart Contract)
The Deed.sol smart contract, written in Solidity, defines a contract Deed that allows a designated lawyer to withdraw funds after a specified time period.
